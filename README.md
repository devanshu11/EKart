This project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.2.7.

Due to the fact that the backend-side contains skeleton codes from Infosys, I didn't include them in this repo.

The frontend is completely designed and built by me.

see my wix blogfor detail screenshots and walkthrough.

To run the application, first install npm and Angular. After that, please run npm install, following by ng serve --open. The browser will automatically open.
