# EKart

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.7.

Due to the fact that the backend-side contains skeleton codes from Infosys, I didn't include them in this repo.

# Description
EKart is a web shop application. It was built using Angular, Bootstrap and jQuery as Frontend, Hibernate and Oracle as Database, and Spring framework as Backend. The development of the project loosely followed the methodology of SCRUM.
 
The app provides few key features:

- User registration/login either as Seller or Customer.
- Account management.
- Display all products.
- Seller can add new products, or modify product details.

The frontend is completely designed and built by me.
