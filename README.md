# EKart

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.7.

Due to the fact that the backend-side contains skeleton codes from Infosys, I didn't include them in this repo.

The frontend is completely designed and built by me.

see [my wix blog](https://xuchen323.wixsite.com/website/single-post/2018/09/11/EKart----A-web-shop-application)for detail screenshots and walkthrough.

To run the application, first install npm and [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart). After that, please run npm install, following by ng serve --open. The browser will automatically open.
